	<p class="western">To write PLC automation ATCM control is used.</p>
	<p class="western">The PLC software consists of a series of cycles called &ldquo;<strong>Task</strong>&rdquo; which are guaranteed to be executed at pre-established times.</p>
	<p class="western">Each task can contain a &ldquo;<strong>program</strong>&rdquo; or more of them, in which the programmer adds his own code with the preferred language. Within the programs 
can be used other blocks of recurring code called &ldquo;<strong>functions</strong>&rdquo; and / or &ldquo;<strong>function blocks</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
	<p class="western">Unlike the functions, the <u>function blocks have these main features</u>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li/>
				<p class="western">debugging available;</p>
				<li/>
				<p class="western">use of timers;</p>
				<li/>
				<p class="western">multiple inputs and outputs.</p>
			</ul>
	<p class="western">It is up to the programmer to choose their use within his own programs.</p>		
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p class="western"><strong>On the device an binary code and not a source code of the PLC program is downloaded. For this reason it is not possible to retrieve the source code of the product from the device.</strong>
		<p class="western"><strong>WARNING:</strong> PLC project must:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<p class="western">Be named as <strong>plc</strong> </p>
		<li>
		<p class="western">Be inside the project folder created by HMI environment (same level as &ldquo;config&rdquo; folder).</p>
