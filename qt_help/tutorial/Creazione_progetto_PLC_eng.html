		<h3 class="western">New project</h3>
	<p class="western">First of all it is necessary to substitute ATHW119_4CVM.kad file in the installation folder:
	ATCMControl &#8594; Engineering &#8594; bin &#8594; ATHW119 with the same file in the installation key (updated version).</p>
	<p class="western">To open a project with default tasks follow path (<strong>MectSuite_xy &#8594; MectApps_xy &#8594;
	&ldquo;AnyTPAC&rdquo; &#8594; Empty_PLC</strong>) to open file <strong>Emty_PLC.4cp</strong> with &ldquo;ATCM control&rdquo;.</p>
	<p class="western"><strong>WARNING:</strong> program for PLC &ldquo;ATCMControl&rdquo; must be run as <strong>administrator</strong> (right click and 
	&ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo;).</p>
	
	<p class="western">The loaded project must be renamed in order to reuse it: </p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Select in the <strong>File</strong> menu </p>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Save Project As&hellip;</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Press &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; key	in the windows that opens</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Then select the folder where to store the project and press OK</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Insert the project name in the row <strong>New Project Name</strong></p>
	</ul>
	<p class="western"><img src="Creazione_progetto_PLC_1.png" name="Immagine158" align="bottom" width="661" height="429" border="0"/></p>
	
	<p class="western">After the project is created, import Crosstable variables into PLC. To do this, in the HMI project open the Crosstable Editor program.</p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Press &ldquo;Controlla&rdquo; key</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Press OK</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Answer YES at the question &ldquo;Save the plc variables file?&rdquo;</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="western" ><img src="Creazione_progetto_PLC_2.png" name="Immagine159" align="bottom" width="626" height="411" border="0"/></p>
	<p class="western">The window to choose where to insert the variables file opens. 
	</p>
	<p class="western">The variables file must be inserted in the PLC folder just created.</p>
	<p class="western">Go back to the ATCMControl environment and look at how the Crosstable variables has been imported in the PLC project.</p>
	<p class="western"><img src="Creazione_progetto_PLC_3.png" name="Immagine160" align="bottom" width="611" height="454" border="0"/></p>
	<ul>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Then	choose <strong>Class</strong> tag</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western">Expanding &ldquo;<strong>Configuration</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>Resource1</strong>&rdquo; file &ldquo;Crosstable.gvl&rdquo; and 
	several Task are found. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p class="western"><img src="Creazione_progetto_PLC_4.png" name="Immagine161" align="bottom" width="268" height="348" border="0"/></p>
	
	<p class="western"><strong>Crosstable.gvl</strong> file contains all <strong>global variables</strong> that is possible to use in the PLC. This file must 
	be used in read only and must not be modified. <strong>WARNING:</strong> these variables are created in the &ldquo;Crosstable Editor&rdquo; and for this 
	reason every time we add a new variable in the Crosstable it is necessary to press &ldquo;Check&rdquo; key and save in the PLC the variables.</p>
	<p class="western">There are 6 <strong>Task</strong> with different <strong>functionalities</strong> and cycle time:</p>
	<ul>
		<ul>
			<li/>
<p class="western">Task0_Init: run only at PLC startup and for this reason has maximum priority. Usually used to initialize variables.</p>
			<li/>
<p class="western">Task1_Alarms: has priority over all other tasks. It starts as soon as the alarm rises and the program inserted in the Task runs once. 
	Task1_Alarms starts every times a new alarm rises.</p>
			<li/>
<p class="western">Task2_Events: has priority over all other tasks except Task1_Alarms. It starts as soon as the event rises and the program inserted in the 
	Task runs once. Task2_Events starts every times a new event rises.</p>
			<li/>
<p class="western">Task3_Fast_10ms: task runs every 10ms.</p>
			<li/>
<p class="western">Task4_Normal_100ms: task runs every 100ms.</p>
			<li/>
<p class="western">Task5_Slow_1000ms: task runs every 1000ms</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p class="western"><strong>WARNING:</strong> we suggest to use <strong>Task4_Normal_100ms</strong> for most part of the application. 
	</p>
	<p class="western">Inside every task there is at least one program, for example if Task5_Slow_1000ms is expanded there is  program Slow_Inst1 where is 
	possible to write, in this case in ST, part of the application. In this way it is possible write code inside present programs in every Task. </p>
